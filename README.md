# hello-world
My (not really) first repository

My name is Nick Proietti. I am a second-year physics and astronomy Ph.D. student. I study the effects of stellar feedback on protoplanetary disk lifetimes in order to help us understand how feedback influences the demographics of exoplanets. In other words, I study what is the link between the high-mass star-forming environment and terrestrial planet formation.
